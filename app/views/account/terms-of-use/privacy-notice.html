        <section id="how-we-share">
          <h2 class="terms-heading">How we share your personal information</h2>
          <p>We sometimes use other organisations to process your personal information on our behalf. When we do, these organisations are bound by our legal agreements to ensure your personal information is secure and used only for the purpose we stipulate.</p>

        <section id="how-long-we-hold">
          <h2 class="terms-heading">How long we hold onto your personal information</h2>
          <p>We hold onto (retain) your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary. In some circumstances the length of time we hold onto your personal information will depend on legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, or necessary technical requirements.</p>
          <p>In any event, we retain your records in line with the Records Management Code of Practice for Health and Social Care (2016).</p>
          <p>Our retention periods are: </p>
          <h3 class="terms-heading-secondary">User accounts</h3>
          <p>We'll hold this information until your accounts are closed or 12 months of no-use. When your account is closed it will be disabled and stored for a further 12 months, in case you want to re-open an account within that period. As the retention of the account is for your benefit, NHS Digital can erase your account on request within the 12-month further storage period.</p>
          <h3 class="terms-heading-secondary">Identity evidence</h3>
          <p>We'll hold this information for 1 year after your account is closed to resolve any complaints, queries or challenges about inappropriate or fraudulent access. The 1 year further is necessary to satisfy this purpose, and therefore requests to prematurely erase this evidence will not be accepted.</p>
          <h3 class="terms-heading-secondary">Log data</h3>
          <p>We'll hold this information for 1 year after the action was logged for example an object identifier (IP address) which shows activity such as webpage access, account login requests and successful and unsuccessful login attempts.</p>
          <h3 class="terms-heading-secondary">Audit events</h3>
          <p>We'll hold this information for 6 years from the event occurring. Audit events use log data as the source to provide awareness to maintain our platform and verification service.</p>
